# GroootMan--Music WebSite
"I developed this project as a way to showcase my proficiency in HTML, CSS, and JS ðŸ’». What sparked my motivation was the removal of the album "Homemade Dukesoul 2015" from YouTube Music ðŸŽµ. I wanted to create a personal version that I could access and enjoy whenever I pleased ðŸŽ¶. After successfully testing it on my local machine, I encountered issues when deploying it online ðŸ¤”. I'm eager to share this project with you, but it works on my local local mechanic."

## This JavaScript code is a component of a music player application, responsible for managing various aspects of audio playback and user interaction. The code is divided into several functional modules, each addressing a specific aspect of the player's behavior.

1. Song Item Creation: The fetchAndCreateSongItems function retrieves a JSON file containing song metadata and generates HTML elements for each song item, incorporating relevant details such as song title, artist, and duration.

2. Playback Control: The playOrPauseSong function toggles the playback state of a song, updating the user interface accordingly. Additionally, the playNextSong and playPreviousSong functions facilitate navigation through the playlist.

3. Progress and Time Updates: The updateProgressAndTime function synchronizes the progress bar and elapsed time displays with the current playback position of the song.

4. Shuffle and Repeat Modes: The toggleShuffleMode and toggleRepeatMode functions enable or disable shuffle and repeat modes, respectively, affecting the playback sequence.

5. User Interface Updates: The updateMasterPlayIcon function updates the master play button's icon based on the playback state, while the updateSongItemClass function modifies the CSS class of the currently playing song item.

6. Event Listeners: The setupControlEventListeners function establishes event listeners for various player controls, including play/pause, next/previous, shuffle, repeat, and volume adjustments.

7. Volume and Mute Control: The updateVolumeIcon function updates the volume icon based on the current volume level, and the toggleMute function toggles the mute state of the player.

8. Time Formatting: The formatTime function converts time values into the mm:ss format for display.

This code utilizes various HTML elements, CSS classes, and JavaScript functions to achieve the desired functionality, incorporating external libraries or frameworks such as Font Awesome for icon graphics. Note that this code is likely part of a larger application, and some functions or variables may be defined elsewhere in the codebase.
